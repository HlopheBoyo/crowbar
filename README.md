# OpenCrowbar has been RENAMED and MOVED

To avoid confusion with the still active, Crowbar Project, this project has been moved and renamed to [Digital Rebar](http://github.com/digitalrebar).

The new Digital Rebar project remains under the active technical stewardship of the original Crowbar and OpenCrowbar founders: Rob Hirschfeld (@zehicle & @ravolt), Greg Althaus (@galthaus) and Victor Lowther (@victorlowther).
